## My process

### Built with

- **[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)** - The latest version of the HyperText Markup Language, used for structuring the content of the web page.
- **[CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)** - Also known as CSS variables, used for theming and maintaining consistent styling across the application.
- **[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)** - A popular CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites quickly and easily.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for efficient UI updates and state management.
- **Responsive Design** - This project is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Key features include:
  - **[Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)** - CSS techniques used to apply styles based on the device's characteristics (e.g., width, height).
  - **[Viewport Meta Tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag)** - Including the viewport meta tag in the HTML to control layout on mobile browsers.
  - **[Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)** - Utilized for flexible and adaptive layout structures.

### What I learned

- **React**: Gained hands-on experience with React for building interactive user interfaces, including components, props, state management, and lifecycle methods.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Learned to use Bootstrap 5 for creating responsive and visually appealing layouts and components.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Utilized CSS variables for theming and maintaining consistent styles across the application.
- **Flexbox**: Applied Flexbox for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design principles to ensure the application works well on various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Viewport Meta Tag**: Used the viewport meta tag to control layout on mobile browsers.
- **Git and GitHub**: Enhanced my understanding of version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.
- **Debugging and Problem-Solving**: Improved my debugging and problem-solving skills by troubleshooting issues and finding solutions during development.
- **Project Structure**: Learned to organize project files and directories effectively for a React application.

### Continued development

- **Advanced React Features**: Explore advanced React features such as context, hooks, and higher-order components to enhance the application's functionality.
- **State Management**: Implement a more robust state management solution, such as Redux or Context API, for better handling of global state.
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the application is reliable and maintainable.
- **Accessibility**: Improve the accessibility of the application to ensure it is usable by a wider range of users, including those with disabilities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the application for better performance, including code splitting, lazy loading, and minimizing render times.
- **Backend Integration**: Integrate with a backend service or API to add dynamic data fetching and persistent data storage.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages to make it publicly accessible.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **User Feedback and Iteration**: Collect user feedback to understand their needs and iterate on the application to improve user experience and add new features.
- **Learning New Technologies**: Continue learning new web development technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date with industry trends and best practices.
